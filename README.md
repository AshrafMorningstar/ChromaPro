## 👑 Website Owner's Manual

### 1. How to Login (Admin Dashboard)

- Click the **"Enterprise Login"** button on the top right.
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password`
- **Security**: The system simulates a secure login. It uses local encryption to enable a persistent session, so you don't have to login every time.

### 2. How to Deploy (Put it Online)

This website is "Client-Side Only", meaning it's very cheap and easy to host.

- **Netlify (Recommended)**: Drag the `chroma-v2` folder to Netlify Drop. It will auto-detect the `netlify.toml` file.
- **Vercel**: Import this repository. It will auto-detect Vite/React.
- **GitHub Pages**: Run `npm run build` and upload the `dist` folder.

### 3. Features Overview

- **Vision Simulator**: Checks color blindness compliance (New in V2).
- **Picker & Tools**: Currently set to "In Development" mode to keep the site looking professional while under construction.
